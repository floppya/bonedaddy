Bonedaddy
=========

[Bonedaddy](https://github.com/floppya/bonedaddy) is a 2D skeletal animation library which
has none of the features you want. It is written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).

This is still barely functional and will probably change dramatically/be rewritten in
the future.

[Here's a sample of it in action](http://floppya.github.com)

Existing features
-----------------
* Load a small subset of [SCML](http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter.htm) files
* Rickety [NME](http://www.nme.io/) renderer which implements a confusing API
* Horribly designed, but well-intentioned, tree-based animation blending system

Notable limitations
-------------------
* The NME renderer currently expects the skin pivot point to always be at (0, 0).
* A special, hidden, bonus limitation to be revealed later.

Usage
-----
* Put yourself in a profoundly tranquil state where unfinished code libraries don't bother you.
* Check out the NME-based example.
